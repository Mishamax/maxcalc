
The idea
========

Add MathML input support in MaxCalc.

It is not very user-friendly and visual to input formulas as text string
especially on touch screen-enabled devices.
It would be great to use something like Windows 7 Math Input Panel (MIP).
This will allow simple and visual expression input.

MIP, like most other math apps uses MathML as its output language.
So adding MathML support can open many possibilities of integration with
different applications.

Implementation
==============

MathML support needs to be added to parser.
Parser needs to be split into backend and frontend, so that single backend
can use various fronends like:
 - Default text string fronend.
 - MathML.
 - LaTeX.

Some universal internal representation is needed between fronend and backend:
 - Use existing text representation (MathML will be converted into it).
 + Use commands of some abstract machine. Everything else will be
    converted into this language by frontends. Backend is a machine,
    implementing this language.
