Building on Windows
===================

Prerequisites:
 - Qt v4.2 or higher (4.4 or 4.5 is recommended).
 - MSVC or MinGW:
     - Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or 2008 (Express Edition should also work if
        you install Platform SDK).
     - Unofficial MinGW build with gcc 4 (http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc/).


Note, that official MinGW with gcc 3 will NOT work due to bad Unicode support.
Thus the standard Qt SDK also won't work (you need to compile Qt from source
using Visual Studio or unofficial gcc 4-based version of MinGW).


To build the sources, execute in "src" directory from Visual Studio Command
Prompt (or MinGW environment):

    qmake
    nmake debug OR nmake release

If you're using MinGW, replace "nmake" with "mingw32-make".
Compiled binaries will be put to "src\debug" and "src\release" directories.
