Building on Windows
===================

Prerequisites:
 - Qt v4.2 or higher (4.4 or 4.5 is recommended).
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or 2008
    (Express Edition may also work if you install Platform SDK, but not tested).

 
Notes about MinGW (and standard prebuilt Qt SDK):

 - Official MinGW with gcc 3 will NOT work due to bad Unicode support.
    Thus standard Qt SDK also won't work (you need to compile Qt from source
    using Visual Studio or unofficial gcc 4-based version of MinGW).
    
 - Unofficial builds with gcc 4 should work, although it is not tested
    (you can get it from http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc/).


To build the sources, execute in "src" directory from Visual Studio Command
Prompt (or MinGW environment):

    qmake
    nmake debug OR nmake release

If you're using MinGW, replace "nmake" with "mingw32-make".
Compiled binaries will be put to "src\debug" and "src\release" directories.


Building on Linux
=================

Compiled binaries will be put to "src\debug" and "src\release" directories.
