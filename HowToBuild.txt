How to build MaxCalc from source
================================

The latest version of MaxCalc including sources can be downloaded from
http://code.google.com/p/maxcalc/.

To get the latest development version, use Mercurial:

    hg clone https://maxcalc.googlecode.com/hg/ maxcalc


Building on Windows
===================

Prerequisites:

 * Qt v4.2 or higher (4.4 or higher is recommended) built with the same
    environment as MaxCalc.

 * You can use MSVC or MinGW compiler:

  * Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or 2008 (Express Edition should also work
        if you install Platform SDK).
  * MinGW with gcc4 (gcc3 doesn't work due to bad Unicode support). If you use
        official Qt SDK, you need version 4.6 because earlier versions include
        old gcc3 compiler.


Using qmake (recommended)
------------------------

To build the sources, execute in "src" directory from Visual Studio Command
Prompt (or MinGW environment):

    qmake
    nmake debug OR nmake release

If you're using MinGW, replace "nmake" with "mingw32-make".
Compiled binaries will be put to "src\debug" and "src\release" directories.

Using CMake
-----------

You can also build MaxCalc using CMake v2.4.4 or higher (2.6 / 2.8 recommended).

Using Visual Studio (from Visual Studio Command Prompt) execute these commands
in "src" directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
    nmake

Using MinGW (from MinGW environment):

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
    mingw32-make

This will create debug build.
To create Release build add "-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" to "cmake" command.


Building on Linux
=================

Prerequisites:
 * Qt v4.2 or higher (4.4 or higher is recommended).
 * gcc 4.

Using qmake (recommended)
-------------------------

To build the sources, execute in "src" directory:

    qmake
    make debug OR make release

Compiled binaries will be put to "src\debug" and "src\release" directories.

Using CMake
-----------


You can also build MaxCalc using CMake v2.4.4 or higher (2.6 / 2.8 recommended).

Execute in "src" directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
    make

This will create debug build.
To create Release build add "-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release" to "cmake" command.
